Course Description: 
Taking examples from global satellite data in gridded/raster format, we will demonstrate several common geospatial operations like projections, resampling, cropping, masking, spatial extraction etc. using rasters, shapefiles, and spatial data frames. For a seamless analysis across different datatypes and platforms, conversion from/to different data formats like data frames, matrices, rasters, and structured data like NetCDF will be discussed. Advanced topics will include working with data cubes (SpatRaster), layer-wise operations on data cubes, cell-wise operations on raster time series by implementing user-defined functions with global, app, tapp and lapp. Parallel implementation of custom functions will be demonstrated for large-scale datasets.
